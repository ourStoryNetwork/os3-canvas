# oS3 Canvas - 1 Page Ecosystem Model

**oS3 Canvas** is a 1-page ecosystem modeling tool that can be used by **one-person businesses, municipalities, STEM programs, and investors**.

## Make Sustainable Urban Planning Accessible to Everyone:

Stop creating businesses that don't have a legitimate impact on your local community. Start communicating your big idea for a **SolarPunk City** clearly and concisely.

An **oS3 Canvas** helps you deconstruct an idea into an ecosystem model using 10 platform teams.

## What is an oS3 Canvas?

An **oS3 Canvas** is a 1-page ecosystem plan template that helps you transform any creative idea into a **SolarPunk City** using ten ecosystem modeling building blocks.

An **oS3 Canvas** can describe a one person business plan, municipal agenda, or even a STEM Curriculum, making it a highly popular ecosystem model innovation and product management tool.

If you have ever written an business plan or created a slide deck for investors, youâ€™ll immediately recognize most of the building blocks on the canvas. We've extended this so it can directly map to a city block.

## **oS3 Canvas** Helps You:

*   **Communicate your idea** clearly and concisely to key stakeholders.
*   **Systematically build and launch** successful **SolarPunk Cities**.

You can outline multiple ecosystem models on an **oS3 Canvas** in one afternoon instead of writing a business plan or urban plan, which can take several weeks or months. 

More importantly, a single-page ecosystem model is much easier to share with others, so it will be read by more people and updated more frequently.
